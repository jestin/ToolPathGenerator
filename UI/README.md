#UI

This project defines the reusable UI componants for the application.  It contains the interfaces for the views and presenters, and the implementation of any chared presenters (which they all should be).  This project is not for the implementation of any views, so there shouldn't be any code in here that is specific to a UI framework (include any web frameworks).
